Raytracer Project

Known Bugs: 
    - refraction makes doesn't seem to have transparent quality and only makes shapes whiter/brighter? color seems to work somewhat
    - cube seems to render as a quad
    - triangle doesn't seem to render properly

Electives:
    - cune
    - Refraction

Extra Credit: triangle

Creative Artifact: I wanted to be able to design something inspired by bubble designs such as this: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/146789269085574247/, however due to the difficulty
in rendering as well as getting the proportions accurate, I settle for a ring of rainbow bubbles within a reflective environment
